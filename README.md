# Get_Med / java
The software idea is to remind the users to take advantage of their medication before it expires. In case of not need of medicines, the users can donate. Additionally, the software solves several problems, such as using the medicine before its expiration date and providing a remedy to those who cannot pay for it. Furthermore, we can gather information about the project by communicating with doctors and pharmacists, especially about medicines that should be taken only with a prescription. Moreover, the tools we will use to develop our software are JavaFX for the interface, MySQL for data storage, and Android Studio, Java.
